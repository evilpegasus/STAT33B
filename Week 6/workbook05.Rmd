This workbook is due __Oct 1, 2020__ by 11:59pm PT.

The workbook is organized into sections that correspond to the lecture videos
for the week. Watch a video, then do the corresponding exercises _before_
moving on to the next video.

Workbooks are graded for completeness, so as long as you make a clear effort to
solve each problem, you'll get full credit. That said, make sure you understand
the concepts here, because they're likely to reappear in homeworks, quizzes,
and later lectures.

As you work, write your answers in this notebook. Answer questions with
complete sentences, and put code in code chunks. You can make as many new code
chunks as you like.

In the notebook, you can run the line of code where the cursor is by pressing
`Ctrl` + `Enter` on Windows or `Cmd` + `Enter` on Mac OS X. You can run an
entire code chunk by clicking on the green arrow in the upper right corner of
the code chunk. 

Please do not delete the exercises already in this notebook, because it may
interfere with our grading tools.

You need to submit your work in two places:

* Submit this Rmd file with your edits on bCourses.
* Knit and submit the generated PDF file on Gradescope.

If you have any last-minute trouble knitting, **DON'T PANIC**. Submit your Rmd
file on time and follow up in office hours or on Piazza to sort out the PDF.



Apply Function Basics
=====================

Watch the "Apply Function Basics" lecture video.

For exercises that mention the dogs data, you can use either `dogs.rds` or
`dogs_tibble.rds`. Both are on the bCourse.

## Exercise 1

1. Suppose you call `sapply()` with a function that returns vectors. What class
   of object does `sapply()` return if all of the result vectors have the same
   length?

   For instance, what if the applied function returns a length-3 vector for
   each element?

   _Hint: `rnorm()` and `class()` are examples of functions that return
   vectors._

2. Again suppose you call `sapply()` with a function that returns vectors. What
   class of object does `sapply()` return if the result vectors have the
   different lengths?

3. Suppose you call `sapply()` with a function that returns different types.
   What happens?

   _Hint: `all.equal()` is one function that returns different types._

**YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE:**

1. `sapply` will return a matrix as the most simplified form.
```{r}
x = c(3, 3, 3, 3)
sapply(x, rnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1)
class(sapply(x, rnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1))
```

2. `sapply` will return a list here because a matrix could not be formed with different row lengths.
```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
sapply(x, rnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1)
class(sapply(x, rnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1))
```

3. `sapply` returns a vector of class character. The `TRUE`s from `all.apply` are coerced into characters.
```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 6)
y = 1
sapply(x, all.equal, current = y)
class(sapply(x, all.equal, current = y))
```

## Exercise 2

1. Use `sapply()` and `is.numeric()` to identify all of the numeric columns in
   the dogs data frame.

2. Use `sapply()` and your result from part 1 to compute the range of every
   numeric column in the dogs data frame.

**YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE:**

1. 
```{r}
dogs = readRDS("data/dogs.rds")
dogs_numerics = sapply(dogs, is.numeric)
dogs_numerics
```

2. 
```{r}
sapply(dogs[ , dogs_numerics], range, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The Split-Apply Strategy
========================

Watch the "The Split-Apply Strategy" lecture video.

## Exercise 3

Use the split-apply strategy to compute the minimum weight (ignoring missing
values) for each size of dog.

**YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE:**

```{r}
sapply(split(dogs$weight, dogs$size), min, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Exercise 4

Use `tapply()` to compute a `summary()` of the weight column for each group
(hound, herding, etc) of dog.

**YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE:**

```{r}
tapply(dogs$weight, dogs$group, summary)
```

## Exercise 5

The `aggregate()` function also implements the split-apply strategy, but
returns the results as a data frame.

Use `aggregate()` to compute the maximum weight (ignoring missing values) for
each group of dog.

_Hint: The `by` parameter in `aggregate()` expects a list or data frame, so use
`[` to select columns for `by` rather than `$` or `[[`._

**YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE:**

```{r}
aggregate(dogs$weight, dogs["group"], max, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Exercise 6

Like `table()`, the `tapply()` function can use multiple categorical features
to cross-tabulate results.

Use `tapply()` to compute the median price (ignoring missing values) for dogs,
grouped by both size and grooming.

_Hint: see the `tapply()` documentation for the `INDEX` parameter._

**YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE:**

```{r}

```

Even More Apply Functions
=========================

Watch the "Even More Apply Functions" lecture video.

## Exercise 7

Translate your code from Exercise 1, Part 1 to use `vapply()` rather than
`sapply()`.
